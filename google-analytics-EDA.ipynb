    "Channels define how users come to your website (Channel Groupings are rule-based groupings of your traffic sources). The default channel groupings can be found [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3297892). These groups are mostly defined by the `Medium`, and some also by  `Source`, `Social Source Referral` or `Ad Distribution Network`. From Google Analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Source: the origin of your traffic, such as a search engine (for example, google) or a domain (example.com).\n",
    "* Medium: the general category of the source, for example, organic search (organic), cost-per-click paid search (cpc), web referral (referral).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "* Organic Search is defined by the medium only (Medium exactly matches organic).\n",
    "* Referral is also defined by the medium only (Medium exactly matches referral).\n",
    "* Social: Social Source Referral exactly matches Yes OR Medium matches regex ^(social|social-network|social-media|sm|social network|social media)$\n",
    "* Direct: Source exactly matches direct AND Medium exactly matches (not set) OR Medium exactly matches (none)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see in the plots, Organic Search and Social led to many sessions, but especially Social delivers hardly any revenues. Referral on the other hand delivers most revenues with a relatively small number of sessions."
